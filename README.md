# 🌸 Poetry Bot - Poem Generator

A gentle, cute web app that lets you generate poems through a chat-like interface. Designed to feel warm and interactive, this project is a fun way to practice JavaScript, regex, and CSS.


## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Generate Poems** – Click "Ready" and receive a randomly selected poem from a Poetry API.
- 🔍 **(In progress) Word Match** – Input a word, and the app will find a poem that contains it.
- 🔊 **(Future Idea) Sound Effects** – Add sound effects to chat interaction to enhance immersion.


## 🎨 Goal

This project is designed to be **gentle and cozy**, making the experience of interacting with poetry feel more natural and inviting. It’s a learning exercise—a space to practice JavaScript, work with regex, and explore design principles with CSS. I also used ChatGPT’s help to guide the development of this project.


## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** (for interactivity)
- **CSS** (for styling the chat-like interface)
- **HTML** (for structuring the UI)
- **[Poetry API](https://poetrydb.org/index.html)** (for fetching poems)
- **ChatGPT** – Helped brainstorm ideas and troubleshoot code.


## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- 📚 Improve poem selection for better matches.
- 🎵 Add soft sound effects for a more immersive chat experience.
- 🖼️ Enhance UI with animations to make interactions smoother.

This is a work-in-progress and a learning journey—feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or just enjoy the poetry 💖
